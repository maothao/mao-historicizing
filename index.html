          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <p>This project looks at the popularity of GIFs in social media and why it is being used in social media. It will provide a summary of the history GIF, namely what has influenced its development and use from its creation to how it is being used in social media now. I will use Facebook as an example of how social media has accepted GIFs.</p>	<p>Using the theoretical framework taken from Christina Haas’ article, On the Relationship Between Old and New Technologies, Haas argues that the existing relationship between old and new technologies need to be complicated, in other words, this relationship needs to be recognized as having more than just the most generic of connections. Although she presents three case studies involving technology in the work place, I intend to adapt this framework to show the development of GIF and its history, to how using GIFs have changed over the years, and how it is being used now in social media. By combining these points to see how it has affected the popularity of GIFs in social media and why/how social media is being used as a medium for GIFs.</p>

          <h1>History and Development of GIF</h1>
		<p>Created in 1987 by CompuServe, GIF, or “Graphics Interchange Format” is a format that uses the LZW, Lempel-Ziv-Welch, compression technique, which reduces image size while maintaining image quality (“GIF,” 1987). There are two versions made to GIF, known as 87a (1987) and 89a (1989). The original version, 87a, supported:</p>			<ul>				<li>LZW compression,</li>				<li>interlacing,</li>
				<li>a color palette of up to 256 colors,</li>				<li>ability to store multiple images</li>
			</ul>		<p>The most recent version, 89a, added additional features such as:</p>		
			<ul>				<li>transparency,</li>				<li>delay times,</li>				<li>Application Extension Blocks</li>			</ul>			<p>(Leurs, n.d. and Edvardsen, n.d)</p>		<p>GIF was actually developed by Steven Wilhite, whom worked for CompuServe. In an article published in CompuServe’s magazine, Online Today, after the release of GIF, it pointed out hardware compatibility and downloading and uploading images within a short amount of time as reasons for its creation. The article described GIF as, “a universal exchange format for high-resolution graphic images [that] is available to microcomputers without regard to hardware compatibility” (“Computer users,” 1987).</p>		<p>As GIF gained traction among computer users, it was embroiled in controversy in 1994 when CompuServe and Unisys announced a licensing agreement. This agreement would require developers to pay a fee to use the LZW compression technique (Battilana, 1995). Unisys held the patent to the LZW technique and because GIF used this technique, Unisys pursued creators and developers seeking to use the technique. The response from the online community was very negative. CompuServe tried to create a version of GIF that did not include the LZW, which came in the form of GIF24 and others created GEF, graphics-exchange format. Eventually, these two attempts merged to be known as PNG, “Portable Network Graphics” (Battilana, 1995).</p>
	<h3>PNG: The Replacement</h3>		<p>PNG, according to W3C, became a W3C recommendation in 1996. PNG is a more advantageous file format to use due to its variable transparency, image brightness control and color correction, and two-dimensional interlacing (Dubost, 2003). In a press release after the W3C recommendation, it described PNG as offering “advantages for brand recognition, product design, medical applications, fine art and on-line catalogs, where visual quality is important”. Furthermore, CompuServe also supported PNG as the new replacement for GIF (World Wide Web, 1996).</p>		<p>Although PNG had better advantages over GIF, it never took off as its creators expected it to. As Battilana (1995) explained, many browsers did not support PNG but many did support GIF. Due to this support, it allowed GIF to persevere even during the LZW patent scandal.</p>

          <h1>How GIFs are used</h1>
          <p>While GIFs are most popularly known for animation nowadays, that was not the original intent of its creation. GIFs stored multiple images to reduce redundancy in files and save space (Edvardsen, n.d.). As GIFs became progressively more popular, users began experimenting with how to use GIFs.</p>	<p>Olia Lialina, a Russian Internet artist, defined three distinct ways that GIFs were used and how it has changed over the years. During the 1990s, the transparency of GIFs allowed it to be placed within different backgrounds and still be noticeable, while exhibiting typical animation concepts.</p>

	<p>During the start of the early 2000s, large, flashy, static graphics dominated sites like MySpace, Geocities, and Angelfire.</p>
		
	<p>Compared to now where moments taken from film and television are being turned into GIFs. The end result is a looped moment (Alfonso III, 2012).</p>	<p>Since the creation of GIF, it has only been updated once, in 1989. Since then, the specifications of GIF have been unchanged. Meanwhile, how users have taken to using it has changed drastically when looking back at the graphics it created to now. Social media has become a major platform for GIFs to be displayed and used as a way of communication.</p>

          <h1>Popularity of GIF and Social Media</h1>
          <p>During the patented period of the LZW, the popularity of GIFs was not too severely affected. Evidence of this would be the Netscape Navigator 2.0’s browser support GIF when it was released in 1996 (Roselli, 2012). This sustained and added additional support for GIFs.</p>	<p>GIFs are not popular due to its technical abilities. Compared to PNG, GIF is an infinitely less superior option. In GIF: A Technical History, GIFs are limited in its color palette, inefficient compression, no sound support, and its very old specifications (Edvardsen, n.d.). However, because of its browser support and looping animation, GIFs are still the most popular option.</p>	<p>When the LZW patent expired in 2004 and GIFs were available for free use again, its popularity jumped. Tracing back its use, GIFs seemed to be commonly used in social media platforms. Why is this? Some attribute the popularity of GIFs to social media sites like Tumblr, which seemed to have reinvented the use of GIFs. What contributed to this would be the looping animation that GIF allows, which didn’t require the user to press play like video formats would require.</p>	<p>According to Jason Eppink (2014), GIFs “can be embedded directly in a webpage, where it loads immediately without plugins or third-party players, because it’s an open format” (p. 303). This is an example of why the simplicity of GIF is its largest redeeming factor. Eppink then concludes, “because of its limitations that the GIF thrives nearly two decades after its introduction, sustaining a renewed interest in the loop” (p. 303).</p> 	<p>Furthermore, the Oxford Dictionary declared GIF the word of the year in 2012. GIFs have spewed countless viral memes and animated videos. Culturally and socially, GIFs are successfully and entrancing because it allows users to connect with a visual aid when reading or scrolling through content. Graig Uhlin (2014) connects the rise of GIF with social networking. That the “nature of the GIF is to circulate, and it therefore thrives in a digital ecosystem build around sharing, retweeting, and following” (Uhlin, 2014, p. 525).</p>

          <h1>Facebook: The Old and the New</h1>
          <p>Considering the popularity of GIF in social media despite its technical limitations, I will look at why Facebook has just recently agreed to support GIF within its platform. Facebook, an enormously popular social networking site, allows users to connect with each other online and to view content about friends, family, and other cultural/social aspects.</p>	<p>In a more general aspect of Haas’ argument outlined earlier, Facebook is a representation of a constantly changing new technology. Facebook is a newer representation of MySpace, its earlier counterpart in the social networking platform. Ultimately replacing MySpace as the social networking site. According to Facebook’s newsroom site, it averages 968 million daily active users and 1.49 billion monthly active users in June 2015 (“Company info,” n.d.). In other words, Facebook caters to a large portion of the population that is active on social media.</p>	<p>GIFs undeniably make up a large part of social media. Facebook’s very recent inclusion of GIFs is historical and opens up a new chapter in its progress. It also poses the question of why Facebook did not originally support GIFs.</p>	<p>Although GIFs are popular, it did not necessarily provide the best user experience. This was MySpace’s largest issue. Eppink (2014) writes that the inflexible layout of MySpace combined with the less than what is now more pleasing to the eye GIFs created a “notoriously messy and chaotic” look, which resulted in terrible user experience (p. 302). This relates back to the technical limitations of GIF. However, how users use GIFs now have changed since the early 2000s. Tumblr’s content consists largely of GIFs and that has not ruined the user experience. Rather, it has become a representation of users using GIFs to relate to technology and to cultural and social aspects of society now.</p>	<p>GIFs provide entertainment and its fun. What originally started out as static, flashing, cheesy animations have become an integral part of how users interact with one another in social media. According to Chowdhry (2015), “Animated GIFs are used in news articles, marketing campaigns, and art galleries nowadays”. Not only are GIFs popularly used in a social media setting, it is also being used in other forms. Facebook has realized this importance and by allowing their users to post GIFs, they have come to understand that despite the risk of ruining user experience, many users are comfortable and welcoming of GIFs. It has, undoubtedly, become a part of social media culture. It is now a common and popular way of communicating online.</p>	<p>Facebook released a statement following their support of GIF, stating that: We built support for animated GIFs to help people express themselves in fun new ways on Facebook. Like many features that we release on Facebook, we want to ensure that this drives a great experience for people first before rolling it out more widely. While Pages cannot currently post GIFs, we are exploring ways to enable this in the future (Chowdhry, 2015).</p>	<p>Users aren’t able to freely post GIFs onto the news feed yet however. Facebook, as their statement also states, is slowly incorporating GIFs onto its platform. As of currently, users are able to post links to GIFs; some users are able to send GIFs through messaging and chat (Lopez, 2014). Since its release in June, Facebook has steadily been adding GIF functions to various outlets. It won’t be too far into the future when users will be able to post GIFs directly onto the Facebook news feed.</p>

          <h1>The Relation Between Haas and GIF</h1>
		<p>As Haas (1999) concluded in her first case study example, “it is hard to see how any of the new technologies… could simply replace the older ones” (p. 216). This case study looked at how work relationships use writing technologies to communicate. In this case, the employees used various different methods to communicate to one another, ranging from handwritten notes to emails, depending on what the situation required as the best form of communication (p. 214).</p>		<p>In the case of GIFs and Facebook, it highlights how GIF could not simply be replaced by a newer and better version of itself, PNG. Despite its benefits over GIF, PNG did not replace GIF. Although it is more commonly used now, and most developers would agree that it is a better format to use, GIF is still very popular due to certain features, like its ability to provide animated graphics. Even more, depending on the purpose of a graphic, it may be better to use GIF or PNG. In a web forum discussing whether to use PNG or GIF, some recommended that PNG be used if image quality is important and the importance of a transparent background when designing a logo (Jurlomindo, 2013).</p>		<p>Haas’ conclusion could also be applied to Facebook and MySpace. As sites with similar intents, for social networking, Facebook did not have GIF support until 2015. This was due to bad user experience while using MySpace and bad animated GIFs at this time.</p>		<p>In Haas’ (1999) second case study, she analyzed how a vision to introduce a city to an electronic communication system failed due to little understanding of the history of the city (p. 218). With GIF, it was popular when it was created because it was the best way to download and upload images among computers with different operating systems (Gerber, 1989). Its popularity increased when Netscape Navigator added support for it. Today, it is just as popular once more based on the animated GIFs ubiquitously seen across social media. Although GIF is technically inferior to other similar formats, there is an appeal to it that has sustained its popularity for so long, even though the GIF specifications have remained largely unchanged since 1989.</p>		<p>Over the course of the development of GIF to how its use has changed over time, its popularity, and finally its popularity and inclusion in social media, GIF has remained the go-to format for animated graphics. Haas’ argument that technologies need to be complicated is present in GIFs and why it has become so popular in social media. The technical functions of GIF, it is easy to use and provides looping animation, is the main reasons why it has remained so popular despite user interface issues. Its recent inclusion in Facebook further supports this. It also supports the idea that GIFs have a large cultural value, and this value has allowed users to express themselves in new and creative ways.</p>
