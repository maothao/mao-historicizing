    <h1>GIF: Old and New Practices and Popularity in Social Media</h1>
      <p class="lead">By Mao Thao</p>
  </div>

					<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/welcome.gif" alt="Jimmy Fallon welcomes you."></div>
    <h1><a id="overview">Overview</a></h1>
      <p>GIFs have become so popular that a regular user of the Internet cannot possibly avoid coming into contact with one. Its popularity is so vast; it is				being used in journalistic means, through social media news sites such as Buzzfeed, which prominently uses GIFs a majority of its articles. Although				it seems more reputable online sites such as the Washington Post have not picked up that GIFs yet, that is not to say that GIFs are not being used to				appeal to online users by businesses and companies that want to appeal to an online audience and in social media.</p>			<p>GIFs are dominating social media. What has led to this change? The popularity of GIFs can be attributed to the change in how it has been used and how
				developers have changed their approach to designing websites. It was not too long ago that GIFs had a notoriously bad reputation, especially when
				thinking back to the era of MySpace, where headache-inducing GIFs ruined the user experience of a website. Now, GIFs are largely derived from videos.
				The end result: a much more visually appealing graphic animation that has allowed users to communicate through more visually creative means than ever
				before with more user-focused designed. </p>

    <h1><a id="framework">Theoretical Framework</a></h1>
			<p>Haas argues that the relationship between old and new technology is more complicated than what is typically portrayed. Haas’ interpretation of				Lev Vygotsky’s concepts of the historical-genetic method and mediational means will be used to understand the historical significance of GIF and why				it has progressed to where it is at now. Bijker’s theory of sociotechnical change, specifically contingent and constraint will be used as theoretical				frameworks. Using these, I will look at the relationship between the old and new practices of GIF and how that has led to its popularity in social media.				Lastly, how this has changed the way users communicate via social media in a cultural and social context.</p>			<p>The historical-genetic method looks at the historic development of an artifact in order to understand its current development. Haas redefines Vygotsky’s				definition by adding technology into the mixture. She states that to understand how technology has influenced literacy, it proposes three points:</p>					<p1>“(a) that multiple technologies for literacy exist, (b) that their history-of-use is complex and overlapping, and (c) that technology’s uses are tied						intrinsically to other human activities” (Haas, 1999, p. 213).</p1>				<ul>					<li>LZW compression,</li>					<li>interlacing,</li>
					<li>a color palette of up to 256 colors,</li>					<li>ability to store multiple images</li>
				</ul>			<p>The most recent version, 89a, added additional features such as:</p>
				<ul>					<li>transparency,</li>					<li>delay times,</li>					<li>Application Extension Blocks</li>				</ul>			<p>(Leurs, n.d. and Edvardsen, n.d)</p>			<p>GIF was actually developed by Steven Wilhite, whom worked for CompuServe. In an article published in CompuServe’s magazine, Online Today,				after the release of GIF, it pointed out hardware compatibility and downloading and uploading images within a short amount of time as				reasons for its creation. The article described GIF as, “a universal exchange format for high-resolution graphic images [that] is available				to microcomputers without regard to hardware compatibility” (“Computer users,” 1987).</p>			<p>As GIF gained traction among computer users, it was embroiled in controversy in 1994 when CompuServe and Unisys announced a licensing agreement.
				This agreement would require developers to pay a fee to use the LZW compression technique (Battilana, 1995). Unisys held the patent to the LZW
				technique and because GIF used this technique, Unisys pursued creators and developers seeking to use the technique. The response from the online
				community was very negative. CompuServe tried to create a version of GIF that did not include the LZW, which came in the form of GIF24 and others
				created GEF, graphics-exchange format. Eventually, these two attempts merged to be known as PNG, “Portable Network Graphics” (Battilana, 1995).</p>
							<h3>PNG: The Replacement</h3>			<p>PNG, according to W3C, became a W3C recommendation in 1996. PNG is a more advantageous file format to use due to its variable transparency, image				brightness control and color correction, and two-dimensional interlacing (Dubost, 2003). In a press release after the W3C recommendation, it				described PNG as offering “advantages for brand recognition, product design, medical applications, fine art and on-line catalogs, where visual				quality is important”. Furthermore, CompuServe also supported PNG as the new replacement for GIF (World Wide Web, 1996).</p>			<p>Although PNG had better advantages over GIF, it never took off as its creators expected it to. As Battilana (1995) explained, many browsers did
				not support PNG but many did support GIF. Due to this support, it allowed GIF to persevere even during the LZW patent scandal.</p>

    <h1><a id="use">The Old and New: How GIFs are used</a></h1>
      <p>While GIFs are most popularly known for animation nowadays, that was not the original intent of its creation. GIFs stored multiple images to reduce				redundancy in files and save space (Edvardsen, n.d.). As GIFs became progressively more popular, users began experimenting with how to use GIFs.</p>			<p>Olia Lialina, a Russian Internet artist, defined three distinct ways that GIFs were used and how it has changed over the years. During the 1990s,
				the transparency of GIFs allowed it to be placed within different backgrounds and still be noticeable, while exhibiting typical animation concepts.</p>
			<p>During the start of the early 2000s, large, flashy, static graphics dominated sites like MySpace, Geocities, and Angelfire.</p>
			<p>Compared to now where moments taken from film and television are being turned into GIFs. The end result is a looped moment (Alfonso III, 2012).</p>

									<p>The above GIFs are examples of GIFs used during the 1990s and early 2000s. This was how GIFs looked pre-Tumblr era. Many GIFs during this time
									were made using graphics, not necessarily taken from images or videos.</p>

									<p>These are examples of GIFs being used now. Many of the GIFs take specific moments from film or television, while others take from animated series
									to loop a memorable moment or describe an emotion or reaction.</p>

    <h1><a id="popularity">Popularity of GIF in Social Media</a></h1>
						<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/bettywhite.gif" alt="Betty White and social media."></div>

      <p>During the patented period of the LZW, the popularity of GIFs was not too severely affected. Evidence of this would be the Netscape Navigator 2.0’s browser				support GIF when it was released in 1996 (Roselli, 2012). This sustained and added additional support for GIFs.</p>			<p>GIFs are not popular due to its technical abilities. Compared to PNG, GIF is an infinitely less superior option. In GIF: A Technical History, GIFs are				limited in its color palette, inefficient compression, no sound support, and its very old specifications (Edvardsen, n.d.). However, because of its browser				support and looping animation, GIFs are still the most popular option.</p>			<p>When the LZW patent expired in 2004 and GIFs were available for free use again, its popularity jumped. Tracing back its use, GIFs seemed to be commonly used				in social media platforms. Why is this? Some attribute the popularity of GIFs to social media sites like Tumblr, which seemed to have reinvented the use of				GIFs. What contributed to this would be the looping animation that GIF allows, which didn’t require the user to press play like video formats would require.</p>			<p>According to Jason Eppink (2014), GIFs “can be embedded directly in a webpage, where it loads immediately without plugins or third-party players, because it’s				an open format” (p. 303). This is an example of why the simplicity of GIF is its largest redeeming factor. Eppink then concludes, “because of its limitations				that the GIF thrives nearly two decades after its introduction, sustaining a renewed interest in the loop” (p. 303).</p>			<p>Furthermore, the Oxford Dictionary declared GIF the word of the year in 2012. GIFs have spewed countless viral memes and animated videos. Culturally and
				socially, GIFs are successfully and entrancing because it allows users to connect with a visual aid when reading or scrolling through content.
				Graig Uhlin (2014) connects the rise of GIF with social networking. That the “nature of the GIF is to circulate, and it therefore thrives in a digital
				ecosystem build around sharing, retweeting, and following” (Uhlin, 2014, p. 525).</p>

    <h1><a id="facebook">Facebook: The Old and the New</a></h1>
					<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/amen.gif" alt="Thank goodness."></div>

      <p>Considering the popularity of GIF in social media despite its technical limitations, I will look at why Facebook has just recently agreed to support GIF within				its platform. Facebook, an enormously popular social networking site, allows users to connect with each other online and to view content about friends, family,				and other cultural/social aspects.</p>			<p>In a more general aspect of Haas’ argument outlined earlier, Facebook is a representation of a constantly changing new technology. Facebook is a newer				representation of MySpace, its earlier counterpart in the social networking platform. Ultimately replacing MySpace as the social networking site. According				to Facebook’s newsroom site, it averages 968 million daily active users and 1.49 billion monthly active users in June 2015 (“Company info,” n.d.). In other				words, Facebook caters to a large portion of the population that is active on social media.</p>			<p>GIFs undeniably make up a large part of social media. Facebook’s very recent inclusion of GIFs is historical and opens up a new chapter in its progress. It				also poses the question of why Facebook did not originally support GIFs.</p>			<p>Although GIFs are popular, it did not necessarily provide the best user experience. This was MySpace’s largest issue. Eppink (2014) writes that the inflexible				layout of MySpace combined with the less than what is now more pleasing to the eye GIFs created a “notoriously messy and chaotic” look, which resulted in				terrible user experience (p. 302). This relates back to the technical limitations of GIF. However, how users use GIFs now have changed since the early 2000s.				Tumblr’s content consists largely of GIFs and that has not ruined the user experience. Rather, it has become a representation of users using GIFs to relate to				technology and to cultural and social aspects of society now.</p>			<p>GIFs provide entertainment and its fun. What originally started out as static, flashing, cheesy animations have become an integral part of how users interact				with one another in social media. According to Chowdhry (2015), “Animated GIFs are used in news articles, marketing campaigns, and art galleries nowadays”. Not				only are GIFs popularly used in a social media setting, it is also being used in other forms. Facebook has realized this importance and by allowing their users				to post GIFs, they have come to understand that despite the risk of ruining user experience, many users are comfortable and welcoming of GIFs. It has,				undoubtedly, become a part of social media culture. It is now a common and popular way of communicating online.</p>			<p>Facebook released a statement following their support of GIF, stating that: We built support for animated GIFs to help people express themselves in fun new				ways on Facebook. Like many features that we release on Facebook, we want to ensure that this drives a great experience for people first before rolling it out				more widely. While Pages cannot currently post GIFs, we are exploring ways to enable this in the future (Chowdhry, 2015).</p>			<p>Users aren’t able to freely post GIFs onto the news feed yet however. Facebook, as their statement also states, is slowly incorporating GIFs onto its
				platform. As of currently, users are able to post links to GIFs; some users are able to send GIFs through messaging and chat (Lopez, 2014). Since its release
				in June, Facebook has steadily been adding GIF functions to various outlets. It won’t be too far into the future when users will be able to post GIFs directly
				onto the Facebook news feed.</p>

    <h1>The Relation Between Haas and GIF</h1>
			<p>As Haas (1999) concluded in her first case study example, “it is hard to see how any of the new technologies… could simply replace the older ones” (p. 216).				This case study looked at how work relationships use writing technologies to communicate. In this case, the employees used various different methods to				communicate to one another, ranging from handwritten notes to emails, depending on what the situation required as the best form of communication (p. 214).</p>			<p>In the case of GIFs and Facebook, it highlights how GIF could not simply be replaced by a newer and better version of itself, PNG. Despite its benefits over				GIF, PNG did not replace GIF. Although it is more commonly used now, and most developers would agree that it is a better format to use, GIF is still very				popular due to certain features, like its ability to provide animated graphics. Even more, depending on the purpose of a graphic, it may be better to use GIF				or PNG. In a web forum discussing whether to use PNG or GIF, some recommended that PNG be used if image quality is important and the importance of a				transparent background when designing a logo (Jurlomindo, 2013).</p>			<p>Haas’ conclusion could also be applied to Facebook and MySpace. As sites with similar intents, for social networking, Facebook did not have GIF support until				2015. This was due to bad user experience while using MySpace and bad animated GIFs at this time.</p>			<p>In Haas’ (1999) second case study, she analyzed how a vision to introduce a city to an electronic communication system failed due to little understanding of				the history of the city (p. 218). With GIF, it was popular when it was created because it was the best way to download and upload images among computers with				different operating systems (Gerber, 1989). Its popularity increased when Netscape Navigator added support for it. Today, it is just as popular once more				based on the animated GIFs ubiquitously seen across social media. Although GIF is technically inferior to other similar formats, there is an appeal to it that				has sustained its popularity for so long, even though the GIF specifications have remained largely unchanged since 1989.</p>			<p>Over the course of the development of GIF to how its use has changed over time, its popularity, and finally its popularity and inclusion in social media, GIF
				has remained the go-to format for animated graphics. Haas’ argument that technologies need to be complicated is present in GIFs and why it has become so
				popular in social media. The technical functions of GIF, it is easy to use and provides looping animation, is the main reasons why it has remained so popular
				despite user interface issues. Its recent inclusion in Facebook further supports this. It also supports the idea that GIFs have a large cultural value, and
				this value has allowed users to express themselves in new and creative ways.</p>
