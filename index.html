    <h1>GIF: Old and New Practices and Popularity in Social Media</h1>
      <p class="lead">By Mao Thao</p>

    <h1><a id="overview">Overview</a></h1>
      <p>GIFs have become so popular that a regular user of the Internet cannot possibly avoid coming into contact with one. Its popularity is so vast; it is				being used in journalistic means, through social media news sites such as Buzzfeed, which prominently uses GIFs a majority of its articles. Although				it seems more reputable online sites such as the Washington Post have not picked up that GIFs yet, that is not to say that GIFs are not being used to				appeal to online users by businesses and companies that want to appeal to an online audience and in social media.</p>			<p>GIFs are dominating social media. What has led to this change? The popularity of GIFs can be attributed to the change in how it has been used and how
				developers have changed their approach to designing websites. It was not too long ago that GIFs had a notoriously bad reputation, especially when
				thinking back to the era of MySpace, where headache-inducing GIFs ruined the user experience of a website. Now, GIFs are largely derived from videos.
				The end result: a much more visually appealing graphic animation that has allowed users to communicate through more visually creative means than ever
				before with more user-focused designed. </p>

    <h1><a id="framework">Theoretical Framework</a></h1>
				<p>Haas argues that the relationship between old and new technology is more complicated than what is typically portrayed. Haas’ interpretation of				Lev Vygotsky’s concepts of the historical-genetic method and mediational means will be used to understand the historical significance of GIF and why				it has progressed to where it is at now. Bijker’s theory of sociotechnical change, specifically contingent and constraint will be used as theoretical				frameworks. Using these, I will look at the relationship between the old and new practices of GIF and how that has led to its popularity in social media.				Lastly, how this has changed the way users communicate via social media in a cultural and social context.</p>				<p>The historical-genetic method looks at the historic development of an artifact in order to understand its current development. Haas redefines Vygotsky’s				definition by adding technology into the mixture. She states that to understand how technology has influenced literacy, it proposes three points:</p>						<p1>“(a) that multiple technologies for literacy exist, (b) that their history-of-use is complex and overlapping, and (c) that technology’s uses are tied						intrinsically to other human activities” (Haas, 1999, p. 213).</p1>				<p>Vygotsky’s mediational means looks at the cultural significance of psychological tools (sign systems) and how it mediates a relationship between the user(s)				and their cultural and historical background (Haas, 1999, p. 212.)</p>				<p>Bijker’s the concept of contingency relates to the actors, or the individuals involved, and “acknowledges [the] human agency” while constraint is what limits				the actor(s) and that these limits are accepted by the agency. Contingency and constraint were used to understand why technology appears to always be changing				but yet still stays constant (Haas, 1999, p. 222).</p>							<h3>Dispute with GIF animations</h3>								<p>The issue with GIFs, in the context of old and new practices and how it has sparked its popularity in social media, would be its specifications. While									useful and easy to use, GIF is outdated compared to other file formats such as PNG. Despite these limitations, GIF is still widely popular. To combat the									limitations of GIF (such as color selections), GIFs are highly effective when design choices regarding websites and GIFs overall are taken into consideration.									This maximizes user experience while providing users an outlet to use GIFs in its most creative form.</p>
    <h1><a id="gif">What is GIF?</a></h1>
    	<p>GIF is a lossless compression image format created in 1987 by CompuServe. Also known as “Graphics Interchange Format,” GIF was perhaps the first				of its kind. Using the LZW, Lempel-Ziv-Welch, compression technique, which reduces image size while maintaining image quality (“GIF,” 1987).</p>			<p>Since its twenty-eight-year reign, GIF has only been updated once, in 1989, only two years after its release. The original version, 87a, had				specifications such as:</p>						<ul>								<li>LZW compression,</li>								<li>interlacing,</li>								<li>a color palette of up to 256 colors,</li>								<li>ability to store multiple images (Leurs, n.d. and Edvardsen, n.d)</li>						</ul>			<p>Version 89a added additional features to GIF such as:</p>						<ul>								<li>transparency,</li>								<li>delay times,</li>								<li>Application Extension Blocks (Leurs, n.d. and Edvardsen, n.d) </li>						</ul>			<p>Overall, GIF’s specifications allow users to compress images without losing the image quality. GIF’s ability to store multiple images also gave				users the ability to create animated GIFs through this feature.</p>    <h1><a id="history">History</a></h1>

					<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/historytechnology.gif" alt="Transformation of technology.">
					<img src="imgs/redbutton.gif" alt="Where's the red button?"></div>

			<p>Steven Wilhite, whom worked for CompuServe, developed GIF. In an article published in CompuServe’s magazine, Online Today after the release of GIF, it pointed out
				hardware compatibility and downloading and uploading images within a short amount of time as reasons for its creation. The article described GIF as, “a universal
				exchange format for high-resolution graphic images [that] is available to microcomputers without regard to hardware compatibility” (“Computer users,” 1987). Before
				GIF, users did not have a way of sending graphics without having to worry about whether format compatibility would even allow them to view graphics
				(“Computer users,” 1987).</p>
			<p>As GIF gained traction among computer users, it was hit with controversy in 1994 when CompuServe and Unisys announced a licensing agreement that would require
				developers to pay a fee to use the LZW compression technique (Battilana, 1995). Unisys held the patent to the LZW technique and because GIF also use this technique,
				Unisys pursued creators and developers seeking to use the technique. The response from the online community was very negative. CompuServe tried to create a version
				of GIF that did not include LZW, which came in the form of GIF24 and others created GEF, graphics-exchange format. Eventually, these two attempts merged to be known
				 PNG, “Portable Network Graphics” (Battilana, 1995).</p>


    <h1><a id="old">Old practices of GIF</a></h1>
					<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/whatisabae.gif" alt="What is a bae?"></div>

			<p>Tracing GIF’s history, it was originally created so users could have a way of transferring or utilizing a technology that would allow everyone to be able to view and
				transfer graphics. CompuServe’s main goal was to reach a point where the “real-time transfer of images” became reality. Among its abilities were other innovative
				opportunities such as “text and images to be scanned simultaneously, rather than being stored separately.” Combined with faster speed, GIF made online slide shows a
				possibility (“Computer users,” 1987).</p>
			<p>At the time of its creation, GIF was a groundbreaking technology. Over the years, GIF’s became more commonly used by the public, not only in a technologically heavy
				environment, but also by those who sought its use in an entertainment and creative sense. It spread to a more mainstream audience: social media users.</p>
			<p>Olia Lialina, a Russian Internet artist, defined three distinct ways that GIFs were used and how it has changed over the years. In the 1990s, “GIFs contain classic
				animation; the backgrounds are transparent so they can be used in many graphical contexts.” Whereas post 2001 saw “Big, motionless, glittering (or other automatically
				generated) graphics used on Myspace and other PimpMyProfile-style social networks” (Alfonso III, 2012). (Doing a simple Google search for Myspace GIFs brings up
				examples such as this: <insert: myspacegifs.png>.)</p>

								<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/ani.businessman2.gif" alt="Businessman gif.">
								<img src="imgs/underconstruction1.gif" alt="Under construction.">
								<img src="imgs/babychick.gif" alt="Baby chick.">
								<img src="imgs/dancingtoast.gif" alt="A toast dancing.">
								<img src="imgs/countdown.gif" alt="5, 4, 3, 2, 1.">
								<img src="imgs/flames.gif" alt="On fire."></div>


			<p>Even at this point, GIFs were being used as a form of entertainment. In social media, it was a way of enhancing and decorating accounts, such as in Myspace. In the
				examples shown, GIFs were flashy and sometimes only consisted of words to maybe describe or emphasize something. According to Quora, a website consisting of experts
				in their fields answer questions posed by users, Carlos Ribeiro described animated GIFs as “something to be ashamed of: bad graphics, crude cartoon-style animations,
				[and] solid colors [etc.]” (Ribeiro, 2012).</p>
			<p>In the case of Myspace, popular at the time, animated GIFs contributed to the bad user experience. GIFs during this time are now considered amateurish and not
				aesthetically pleasing. The user interface of Myspace was not effective and the overload of animated GIFs contributed to the bad user experience.</p>
			<p>According to Jim Boulton’s (2014) article 9 Design Ideas That Shaped The Web, GIF did not truly become popular until 1996 when Netscape Navigator 2.0 added animated
				GIF support. Boulton (2014) also summarized the calamity of web design in the 1990s as “[competing] for space within frames and tables. At this point, the web was
				also still considered largely text-based with little focus on how users would actually navigate and use a site (Dilger, n.d., p. 216). It was during this time, the
				late 1990s to early 2000s, that more developers started using grids and templates (Quaintance, 2013).</p>



  	<h1><a id="new">New practices of GIF</a></h1>

								<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/elmodomination.gif" alt="GIFs are cool."></div>

			<p>Comparing why GIF was first created to where it is at now, it has gradually become a major part of social media. New practices are using GIF differently compared to old
				practices. Although, as Haas (1999) differentiates in her argument and as Bijker's concept of contingency and constraint, similarities still exist in the old and new practices
				(p. 212).</p>
			<p>New practices involve a more detached integration between GIF and the overall design of a site. In Olia Lialina’s last distinction of GIF practices, GIFs are presently
				in the form of “Looped sequences made from video captures of movies or TV shows, distributed in blogs, not integrated into the page design surrounding it”
				(Alfonso III, 2012). While taking a minimalistic approach to design so the user can focus more on animated GIFs and any content that follows it, new practices still share
				the same core beliefs as old practices. To create a format that is easy to use and embeddable in all types of browsers.</p>

								<img src="imgs/hungryforthanksgiving.gif" alt="Turkey time!"></div>


			<p>Animated GIFs are derived largely from video content. Most of the examples above originated from television. Searching Tumblr or animated GIF content websites such as giphy.com
				will more than likely provide search results of GIFs taken from movies, TV shows, or televised events. Specific scenes are taken out and put on a loop, to be played over and
				over again. Eppink (2014) writes that GIFs became a way for users to communicate with one another via being used in response or to respond to online content (p. 303).</p>
			<p>Many social media sites have changed their user interface to place a focus on the content, e.g., animated GIF, rather than cluttering the interface. Facebook, for one,
				was initially reluctant to introduce GIF into its UI due to Myspace’s UI failure (Eppink, 2014, p. 302). However, even Facebook, perhaps the largest social networking site right
				now, could not continue to refuse its users the opportunity to post and share animated GIFs.</p>
			<p> Tumblr, on the other hand, is credited with “igniting mainstream interest in the GIF as an aesthetic form” (Eppink, 2014, p. 302). Tumblr actively used GIFs as a part of
				written conversations. Their users were able to publish written content and accompany that with animated GIFs (Eppink, 2014, p. 302). Rather than becoming a part
				of the design, GIFs are a way for social media users to interact even more with each other with an easy to navigate user interface. Tumblr’s current interface is minimal and easy for
				users to use. The different approach to designing a site and how animated GIFs are created have, together, created a simple method of supplying a visual aid to digital content.</p>
							<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/tumblrscreenshot.png" alt="Tumblr interface.">

			<p>In comparison to old practices, these (new) practices have changed overtime. Users have found more creative means of using GIFs and web designing overall has drastically improved.
				Good user-focused design combined with slicker animated GIFs have revolutionized the GIF format.</p>
			<p>GIF’s ability to create animated looping graphics is perhaps the main reason how it has managed to stay on top throughout its twenty-eight year history. The overall simplicity of
				GIF and its widely supported format are why it is still being used. Despite better and far more sophisticated formats that can be used in place of GIF, many users still choose GIF.</p>

		<h1><a id="popularity">Popularity in social media</a></h1>
		<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/bettywhite.gif" alt="Betty White and social media."></div>
			<p>Graig Uhlin (2014) connects the rise of GIF with social networking; that the “nature of the GIF is to circulate, and it therefore thrives in a digital ecosystem build around sharing,
				retweeting, and following” (p. 525). This is perhaps also why Oxford Dictionary declared GIF the word of the year in 2012. GIFs have spewed countless viral memes and animated videos.
				Culturally and socially, GIFs are successful and entrancing because it allows users to connect with a visual aid when reading or scrolling through content. It provides added visual
				entertainment, proving that quick sudden movements are not necessarily detrimental to the user experience.</p>
			<p>Its technical abilities compared to PNG are the reasons for its success in social media. By providing a way for social media users to create fun, interesting “reactions,” or visual
				proponents to what takes place online; GIF has integrated itself into social media culture.</p>

		<h1><a id="analysis">Theoretical framework analysis</a></h1>
							<h3>Historical-genetic method</h3>
									<p>GIFs, despite issues with user experience, provide entertainment and are a fun way for users to enhance their chosen methods of communicating content. Haas (1999) stated
										that the “Vygotskian approach to the study of technology, then, suggests (a) that multiple technologies for literacy exist, (b) that their history-of-use is complex and
										overlapping, and (c) that technology’s uses are tied intrinsically to other human activities (p. 213).</p>
									<p>Tackling this approach and applying it to the popularity of GIF in social media based on old and new practices, the historical aspect of GIF is an important one. Its developers
										sought an easier way of compressing multiple files to make the transfer of data easier during a period where Internet speeds were slow and uncompromising. Thus GIF was created
										with these limitations in mind and although most users may not recognize this, the reasons for the development of GIF are still very prominent today.</p>
									<p>GIF was created to be easy and simple to use. Even now, GIF still stands at the top of most formats because users can easily make animated graphics compared to creating videos.
										GIF has auto-looping, can be expected to work in any setting or browser, and overall fun (Beck, n.d.). Taking into account that there are also now other options of image formats
										to use besides GIF, such as PNG. Though most social media users use GIF, there are also those who choose to use other methods of creating images and graphic animations.</p>
									<p>Lastly, how users choose to use GIFs as a supplemental visual aid to their content (literacy) further emphasizes why GIFs have become so popular today. By trying to understand
										the historical-genetic method, Vygotsky describes narrows down to one point. That although how GIFs are used has changed vastly, GIFs had been and will still most likely be used
										as a form of entertainment and of expressing something of the user’s own personal thoughts.</p>
							<h3>Mediational means</h3>
									<p>Vygotsky’s concept of mediational means, which Haas (1999) describes as “a technological change [that] cannot be a simple replacement of one technology with another—nor even an
										historical rupture between technologies—because technology is anchored so closely both to individual histories and to cultural practices” (p. 212).</p>
									<p>GIFs are not simply replaced by old and new methods of use. Instead, the change from old to new practices is an adaptation of how it has been used. Historically, GIFs are still being
										used as a form of entertainment, as a visual aid to content online, and a way of expression for users. These core beliefs still exist today based on social media uses of GIFs. Mediational
										means also “carry cultural power and cultural history, but they are always instantiated in specific ways in actual use” (Haas, 1999, p. 212).</p>
							<h3>Contingency and constraint</h3>
									<p>GIF is an interesting format to say the least. Contingency and constraint are used to help understand why technology is always seemingly changing yet still remains constant. In the case of
										GIF, it is a technology that could be considered one of the first of its kind. Eventually branching off and influencing other forms of technology similar to it yet with better specifications.
										PNG, for example, is considered by most developers to be the superior alternative to GIF, an outdated format that should have been replaced by PNG long ago.</p>
									<p>Based on the analysis of old and new practices of GIF, GIF is a constant yet changing technology. Changing in how users have approached using it while GIF as a technology has remained the same
										since 1989. Every aspect in the development and history of GIF has been due to constraints made by other technologies of its time. GIF was created in response to the lack of versatile technology
										that could display graphics in various computer hardwares. Despite the scandal of the LZW patent, GIF still thrived because developers made the conscious decision to include it in Netscape
										Navigator 2.0. Changes in web designing contributed to increased popularity of GIF use because animated GIFs were, for once, not competing with other components of a website. Websites such as Tumblr
										were created almost solely focusing on animated GIFs and its overall web layout emphasized this.</p>
									<p>Despite newer and better available options of graphic formats, GIF is still being used because it is simple to use, provides looping animation, and maybe because its developers have created a technology
										that still meets the needs to its users 28 years later.</p>
